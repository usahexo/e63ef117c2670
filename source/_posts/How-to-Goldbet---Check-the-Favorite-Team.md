# 4. Know Who the Favorite Team Is for Sports Betting with Goldbet

There is no need to be a genius in order to place sports bets, but it can be very helpful if you know some basics about it. Goldbet offers a wide variety of betting markets for punters to explore and make some profits. If you want to become successful in sports betting, then you need to identify the favorite team of the sporting event you are betting on.

The first step is obviously to identify the favorite team by looking at the odds offered. Odds are usually expressed in terms of fractions or decimals, and they indicate how likely a particular event is going to happen. The bookmaker always tries to balance the amount of money being wagered on each outcome, so when there is more money bet on one side, the odds on that side will get shorter. This means that the favorite team is typically offering lower odds than the underdog team.

Shortening Odds and Favorites

In order to make money from betting on sports, it is important that you back the favorites when their odds are shortening. However, this doesn't mean that you should always back the favorites blindly – there are other factors that you need to take into account when placing your bets. You also need to factor in things such as injuries, suspensions and home or away advantage. For example, if Liverpool are playing against Manchester City and Liverpool are at home, then they would be considered as the favorites even though their odds may not be as short as they would be if they were playing away from home.

If you want to become successful in sports betting then it is important that you learn how to read and understand betting odds. Once you have a good understanding of how they work, then you will be able to identify the favorites much more easily and make some profits by backing them at shorter odds.
