#  What are the controls?

The controls in a car are what you use to steer, brake and accelerate the car.

The steering wheel is the most important control in a car - it's what you use to guide the car in the direction you want to go. The brake and accelerator pedals are also important, as they control how fast and how much the car brakes or speeds up.

There are also a number of other controls in a car, including: turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers and headlights. Each of these controls has a specific purpose, and it's important to know how to use them properly when you're driving.

#  How does one Sugar Pop?

In the world of candy, there are two types of people: those who love Sour Patch Kids and those who love Pixy Stix. There is no in between. I am of the second kind. Growing up, my grandparents would always buy a pack of Pixy Stix for me and my cousins whenever we would visit. And now, as an adult, I still get a nostalgic feeling when I see them at the store.

For those of you who have never had a Pixy Stix, they’re basically a super-sized straw filled with powdered sugar. You suck the sugar out of the straw and it coats your tongue and teeth with sweetness. They’re basically like a drug; once you start sucking, you can’t stop.

There’s something about that sweet, powdery taste that just makes me happy. It’s like pure joy in a straw. And unlike Sour Patch Kids, which can be sickly sweet, Pixy Stix are light and refreshing.

If you want to experience true sugar happiness, head to your nearest convenience store and buy yourself a pack of Pixy Stix. Trust me, you won’t regret it!
