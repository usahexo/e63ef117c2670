#  Microgaming Plank to Release Sequel to Casino Royale

Microgaming has announced that they will be releasing a sequel to the 2006 movie, Casino Royale. The new game is set to release in early 2019 and will be available on desktop and mobile devices.

Casino Royale was one of the most popular Microgaming slots of all time, so it’s no surprise that they’ve decided to release a sequel. The new game will feature 5 reels and 30 paylines, with players able to win up to 1,000x their bet.

Some of the bonuses you can expect to find in the game include a free spins bonus, a scatter bonus and a wilds bonus. There’s also a progressive jackpot available, so players can potentially win big if they hit the right combination.

 Casino Royale was a huge success both at the box office and online, so we’re expecting big things from the sequel. If you want to be one of the first to try it out, make sure you sign up for an account at one of our recommended casinos.

#  Casino Royale 2 Set for Release in Early 2017

After much anticipation, MGM has finally announced that the sequel to Casino Royale will hit theaters in early 2017. The film, which is still currently in production, is rumored to follow a similar plot to the 2006 original, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as James Bond.

In addition to Craig, several other high-profile actors are confirmed to appear in the sequel, including Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, and Dave Bautista. Filming is scheduled to wrap up in early fall, leaving plenty of time for post-production work ahead of the planned release date.

Casino Royale 2 has been one of the most eagerly anticipated sequels in recent memory, and it should provide a nice boost for MGM following the disappointing performance of last year's Jupiter Ascending. In the meantime, fans can keep busy by checking out the other upcoming James Bond films such as Spectre and Skyfall.

#  Microgaming Plans All-New Casino Royale Movie

Microgaming, one of the largest and most successful casino software providers in the world, has announced plans to produce an all-new Casino Royale movie.

The movie is a prequel to the 2006 James Bond film of the same name and will tell the story of how Bond first became a secret agent. It is set to be released in late 2020.

Microgaming has already secured several big-name Hollywood actors to star in the movie, including Daniel Craig (James Bond), Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) and Richard Madden (Boris).

The company is also investing heavily in production, with a budget of over $100 million. This is sure to make Casino Royale one of the most anticipated movies of 2020.

Casino Royale will be Microgaming’s third attempt at producing a major motion picture. The company’s previous two movies, 2016’s Eddie The Eagle and 2018’s Aloha!, were both box office flops. However, Microgaming is confident that the new Casino Royale movie will be a success.

In a statement, CEO John Coleman said: “We are extremely excited about this project. Casino Royale is one of the most iconic James Bond movies ever made and we are confident that our version will be just as successful. We are committed to making this the best movie possible and we are confident that it will be a huge hit with audiences worldwide.”
