#  Pa. legalizes sports betting, big daddy casino is already taking bets!

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of several other states. The bill now goes to the Senate for approval before it heads to Governor Tom Wolf’s desk to be signed into law.

Supporters of the bill say that it will bring in much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing a budget shortfall. They also argue that it will help keep people from gambling illegally.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and crime.
