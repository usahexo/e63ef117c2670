#  REAL MADRID'S ODDS OF WINNING BACK-TO-BACK UEFA CHAMPIONSHIPS

After an impressive Champions League performance in the 2017/2018 season, Real Madrid is looking to make history by becoming the first team to win back-to-back UEFA Champions League trophies. However, their odds of achieving this are not as good as they may seem.

A recent study by the CIES Football Observatory showed that out of the 68 clubs who have participated in the UEFA Champions League since its inception in 1992/1993, only 11 have managed to defend their title. This gives Real Madrid a 14% chance of winning back-to-back UEFA Champions League trophies.

Interestingly, Spanish clubs have fared better than any other nation when it comes to defending their title, with six out of the 11 successes coming from La Liga. This could be due to the fact that Spanish clubs tend to have more money available to spend on players than other leagues, which gives them an edge in European competition.

Aside from Real Madrid, Barcelona is the only other Spanish club to have won back-to-back UEFA Champions League titles, doing so in 2006 and 2007. However, Barcelona's odds of repeating this feat are even lower than Real Madrid's, with CIES Football Observatory giving them a 9% chance of success.

Italian clubs have been the next most successful when it comes to defending their UEFA Champions League title, with six different teams managing to do so. The last Italian club to achieve this was Juventus in 2015/2016. However, Juventus' odds of retaining their title next season are currently at 12%.

German clubs trail behind Italian and Spanish clubs when it comes to defending their UEFA Champions League title, with only four teams managing to do so. The most recent German club to win back-to-back UEFA Champions League titles was Bayern Munich in 2013 and 2014. Bayern Munich's odds of repeating this feat next season are currently at 13%.

The team with the best chance of winning back-to-back UEFA Champions League trophies next season is Manchester City, who have a 20% chance of success according to CIES Football Observatory. This is largely due to the fact that Manchester City has been one of the most consistent teams in Europe over the past few years, reaching at least the semi-finals every season since 2016/2017.

#  3 TO 1: REAL MADRID FAVORED TO WIN LA LIGA TITLE

In Spain, the top-tier professional football league is known as La Liga. It is made up of 20 teams, and the season runs from August to May. At the end of the season, the team that has earned the most points is crowned the champion.

This year, La Liga looks like it will be a close race between 3 teams: Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Atlético Madrid. Out of these 3 teams, Real Madrid is favored to come out on top.

Real Madrid has been one of the most successful clubs in Europe over the past decade. They have won 4 Champions League titles in the last 10 years and have consistently been one of the top teams in La Liga. This year, they are led by manager Zinedine Zidane and stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric.

Barcelona has also been a powerhouse in Europe for many years. They have won 5 Champions League titles (the most of any team) and are always among the top teams in Spain. This year, they are led by superstar Lionel Messi and manager Ernesto Valverde.

Atlético Madrid is a bit of an underdog in this race, but they are no slouches. They have won La Liga twice in recent years and have always been a contender. This year, they are led by manager Diego Simeone and stars like Antoine Griezmann and Jan Oblak.

All 3 of these teams are capable of winning La Liga this year, but Real Madrid is likely to come out on top. They are the defending champions and have always been one of the strongest teams in Europe. With Zidane at the helm and Ronaldo playing at his best, Real Madrid looks poised to win another title this year.

#  GARETH BALE HAS 5/1 ODDS TO WIN BALLON D'OR

Gareth Bale is on the shortlist for the Ballon D’Or this year and he has 5/1 odds of winning it. He has been on fire for Real Madrid this season and he will be looking to win his third Champions League trophy. He has also been helping Wales qualify for their first ever World Cup.

Bale was injured for most of last season, but he has come back stronger than ever this year. He has scored 16 goals in all competitions so far and he is looking to add to that total in the Champions League final against Liverpool.

Bale is up against some tough competition for the Ballon D’Or, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar. But he definitely has a chance of winning it if he continues playing like he has been this season.

Some people have questioned whether Bale is actually worth €100 million, but he has proved himself time and time again at Real Madrid. He is one of the best players in the world and there is no doubt that he will be remembered as one of the greats when he eventually retires.

#  CRISTIANO RONALDO HAS 2/1 ODDS TO WINS FIFA WORLD PLAYER OF THE YEAR

After a great season with Real Madrid and Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo is the favorite to win the FIFA World Player of the Year. Ronaldo had a stellar year, leading Madrid to their 10th Champions League title and helping Portugal make it to the World Cup semi-finals.

Ronaldo has 2/1 odds to win the award, according to oddsmakers at Betway. Neymar is second on the list with 5/2 odds, followed by Lionel Messi (7/2) and Mohamed Salah (9/2).

This is the fourth time that Ronaldo has been nominated for FIFA's top player award. He won the honor in 2008, 2013, and 2014. In 2017, he finished in second place behind Messi.

Ronaldo had an impressive season in 2018, scoring 44 goals in all competitions for club and country. He was also named UEFA Men's Player of the Year and La Liga's Best Player.

Neymar had a good season himself, scoring 28 goals in all competitions for Paris Saint-Germain. However, he missed significant time due to injury and was not as dominant as he has been in past years.

Messi had another strong year, scoring 45 goals for Barcelona in all competitions. However, he was unable to lead Argentina to a World Cup victory and lost out to Ronaldo for UEFA Men's Player of the Year.

Salah had a record-breaking season for Liverpool FC, scoring 44 goals in all competitions. However, he was injured early on in the Champions League final and was not able to help Liverpool win their sixth European title.

#  7/2 ODDS THAT REAL MADRID WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

There is no question that Real Madrid are one of the top football clubs in the world. They are always competing for trophies, and this year they are looking to win their third consecutive Champions League trophy.

The odds of them winning the tournament are currently at 7/2, which means that they have a pretty good chance of winning. Those odds could change as the tournament progresses, but for now they are still pretty favourable.

One of the things that has helped Real Madrid succeed in Europe is their strong team chemistry. They have been able to develop a good team spirit, and this has allowed them to battle through tough fixtures.

In addition to their team chemistry, they also have some very talented players. Players such as Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo can make a huge difference on the pitch, and they often score crucial goals in big games.

Clearly, Real Madrid have many strengths that could help them win the Champions League. They are definitely one of the teams to watch out for in this year’s tournament.
