#  Who is Benicio Del Toro's father? 

There is much mystery surrounding actor Benicio Del Toro's father. His mother, Carmen Lizarralde, has said that she does not know who his father is. In a 2007 interview with Vanity Fair, Del Toro said that he had asked his mother about his father and she told him "a little bushman who came out of the jungle and raped me." However, in a 2011 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Del Toro said that his father was "a doctor in Puerto Rico." 

Despite these conflicting reports, there are a few potential candidates for Benicio Del Toro's father. One is Rafael Trujillo Molina, the dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961. Trujillo was known for having many affairs with women, and it is believed that he may have fathered many children illegitimate children. Another possible candidate is Pedro Albizu Campos, a Puerto Rican independence activist who was closely associated with Trujillo. Albizu Campos is rumored to have been Del Toro's biological father, but this has never been confirmed.

#  How many times has Benicio Del Toro been nominated for an Oscar? 

Benicio Del Toro has been nominated for an Oscar twice in his career. His first nomination came in 2001 for his role in Traffic, and he was again nominated in 2015 for his role in Sicario.

#  Why did Benicio Del Toro turn down a role in The Hangover?

In a recent interview, Benicio Del Toro revealed that he was offered a role in "The Hangover" but turned it down because he "didn't want to be in a movie where people are getting drunk."

"The Hangover" went on to become one of the highest-grossing comedies of all time and made stars out of its main cast, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms.

Interestingly, Del Toro's decision may have cost him some big bucks. In 2009, he was Forbes' highest-paid actor in Hollywood, earning $20 million for his work in "Wolfman." It's safe to say that he could have earned at least that much for his role in "The Hangover."

So why did Del Toro turn down the role? He has spoken about his struggles with addiction in the past and may have felt like he couldn't associate himself with a film that glorifies drinking. In fact, Del Toro has said that he doesn't even drink alcohol himself.

It's possible that Del Toro's decision will make him a more respected actor in the long run. He is known for choosing roles that are interesting and challenging rather than those that will make him the most money. In an industry where so many actors seem to just be looking out for themselves, it's refreshing to see someone who is willing to pass up a chance at easy money in order to do something they believe in.
