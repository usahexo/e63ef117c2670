#  Manchester United Struggles to Remain in Top 4

Manchester United’s struggles to remain in the top 4 of the Premier League this season have been well documented. The Red Devils are now in serious danger of missing out on Champions League qualification for the second consecutive season, and many fans and pundits are calling for manager Louis van Gaal to be sacked.

United got off to a bad start this season, losing two of their first three games. They then went on a run of nine consecutive victories in all competitions, but they have since faltered again and have only won two of their last six games. This poor form has seen them knocked out of the Europa League and fall to fifth place in the Premier League table, four points behind fourth-place Manchester City with a game in hand.

There are several reasons for United’s struggles this season. Their defence has been particularly poor, as they have conceded more goals than any other team in the top seven. They have also been unable to score regularly, with only Tottenham Hotspur scoring fewer goals than them in the Premier League. In addition, their playing style has been criticised by many pundits, with many accusing van Gaal of playing too much dull and defensive football.

The Dutchman is under pressure to turn things around at United and he will be hoping that his side can get a win against Liverpool on Sunday afternoon. A loss against their bitter rivals would see them fall further behind in the race for fourth place and could spell the end for van Gaal at Old Trafford.

#  Liverpool Falls Victim to Late Manchester City Goal

Liverpool’s unbeaten streak came to an end on Sunday as Manchester City scored in the dying minutes of the match to earn a 2-1 victory at Anfield.

Pep Guardiola’s side had struggled to create much in the way of clear-cut chances, but they made the most of their only real opportunity of the game as Leroy Sané’s late strike gave them all three points.

The goal was Sané’s sixth in his last four Premier League games and lifted Manchester City back above Liverpool into first place in the table.

Jürgen Klopp’s side had arrived at Anfield looking to extend their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 20 games, but they were undone by a late goal from their title rivals.

And despite enjoying plenty of possession, they were unable to find a way through Manchester City’s well-organised defence.

Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead early in the second half, but they were unable to hold on for all three points as Sané struck late on.

It was a frustrating afternoon for Liverpool, who have now dropped points in consecutive matches after previously going unbeaten in 18 games.

But they remain top of the Premier League table and still have a six-point lead over Manchester City heading into the final few months of the season.

#  Arsenal Limps into 3rd Place with Dramatic Win Over Everton

Arsenal’s struggles continued as they limped into 3rd place in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Everton. The Gunners have looked out of sorts for much of the season, and it was on full display against Everton.

Everton had the majority of the possession, and Arsenal struggled to create chances. The only goal of the game came in the 83rd minute, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a dramatic winner.

Arsenal will be happy to have secured all three points, but they will need to improve significantly if they are going to compete for the Premier League title.

#  Tottenham Hotspur Continues to Struggle Without Star Striker Harry Kane 

 Spurs kicked off their Europa League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Cypriot side AEL Limassol at White Hart Lane on Thursday night. However, the victory came at a cost as Harry Kane, the club's top scorer last season, was sidelined with an ankle injury.

Kane had been in sensational form this season, scoring six goals in all competitions. He will now miss Tottenham's next three games, including Sunday's Premier League clash against Liverpool.

The England international's absence was felt as Tottenham struggled to create chances against AEL Limassol. The only goal of the game came from Ryan Mason, who fired home from close range in the second half.

Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping that Kane can return to action sooner rather than later as Tottenham look to compete on multiple fronts this season.

Despite the win, Spurs are still lacking a cutting edge without their star striker and will need to improve if they are to challenge for silverware this season.

#  Chelsea Wins 22nd Consecutive Game, Moves into First Place

The Blues continue their winning ways, increasing their streak to 22 games with a 3-1 victory over Newcastle United. This latest win moves them into first place in the Premier League table.

Chelsea has been the dominant force in English soccer this season, and they have continued their impressive play as we move into the new year. The club has now won 22 consecutive games, with goals from Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, and Marcos Alonso getting the job done against Newcastle United.

Costa’s goal came in the first half, and Hazard and Alonso added insurance goals in the second half to make sure of the victory. The Blues are now one point clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table, and they will be looking to extend their winning streak as we head into the final months of the season.

This is an incredible accomplishment for Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, who has turned things around for this club after a disappointing 2015-16 season. The Blues were able to win the Premier League title that year, but they were not very impressive in Europe and they failed to make it out of the group stage in Champions League play.

Conte has brought a new level of intensity to Chelsea this season, and it has resulted in some great play on the pitch. The Italian manager deserves a lot of credit for this impressive run, and he will be looking to lead his team to even more success as we head into the latter stages of the season.
