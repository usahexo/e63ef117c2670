#  MGM Springfield Plans to Open 10 More Movie Theaters in Mozambique

MGM Springfield announced plans to open 10 more movie theaters in Mozambique by 2021. The new theaters will feature the latest movies and advance technology, including ultra-high definition screens and immersive sound systems.

“This is an important strategic initiative for MGM Springfield as we continue to grow our global footprint,” said MGM Springfield CEO Mike Mathis. “The movie theater business is booming internationally and there is a great opportunity to provide world-class entertainment experiences to people in Mozambique.”

The new theaters are expected to create hundreds of jobs in Mozambique, and contribute millions of dollars to the local economy. They will be located in major metropolitan areas, including Maputo, Beira, Nampula, and Quelimane.

#  Mozambique Film Fest Adds MGM Springfield's 10 Theaters

The Mozambique Film Festival announced Monday that it has added MGM Springfield's 10 theaters to its program.

The six-day festival, which begins Sept. 24, will now include a screening of "Free Solo" at the Loews theater in the casino complex. The documentary about climber Alex Honnold won the Academy Award for best documentary earlier this year.

MGM Springfield has also committed to sponsoring a Filmmaker Boot Camp coinciding with the festival, organizers said. It will be open to all filmmakers, including students, with an interest in making films in Africa or about African topics.

Festival Director Nuno Vaz said the festival is grateful for MGM Springfield's support. "We are excited to be partnering with them and to be able to offer our attendees even more great content," he said in a statement.

MGM Springfield President Michael Mathis said the sponsorship is part of the company's commitment to developing arts and culture in Massachusetts. "Our theaters are perfect venues for film screenings and we're delighted to support this important event that celebrates artistic achievement from around the continent," he said.

#  Mozambique Goes All In on MGM Springfield's 10 Theaters

Mozambique is betting big on Springfield, MA's new MGM casino resort. The $960 million development is set to open in late 2018 and will include 10 movie theaters.

The theaters are a key part of the resort's entertainment offerings, which also include a music venue, bowling alley, and arcade. They're expected to draw big crowds not just from Springfield but also from the surrounding area, including Connecticut and Vermont.

MGM Springfield is promising a "world-class cinematic experience" with its theaters. Seat reservations and advance ticketing will be available, and the theaters will offer food and drinks as well as traditional movie theater fare like popcorn and candy.

Mozambique's investment in the casino resort is part of a broader push to revive its economy. The country has been struggling since 2013, when it was hit by two major cyclones that caused widespread damage and killed more than 1,000 people.

The casino resort is seen as a key part of Mozambique's efforts to attract tourists and generate jobs. It's expected to create 5,000 jobs during construction and 3,000 permanent jobs when it opens.

Mozambique isn't the only country targeting Springfield's new casino resort. MGM has also been wooing officials in nearby Hartford, CT with offers of job creation and tax revenue.

#  10 More Cinemas for MGM Springfield in Mozambique

MGM Springfield is expected to open in the fall of 2018. The $950 million complex is a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Polisario. It will be the first full-scale resort casino in Africa.

The casino resort will include a luxury hotel, high-end shops, restaurants, two cinemas, and a spa. Construction has already begun on the project, which is expected to create 5,000 jobs.

MGM Springfield is not the only casino resort planned for Africa. Another $2.5 billion project is planned for Lagos, Nigeria. That project will include a massive casino, three hotels, a convention center, and several restaurants.

The growth of the gaming industry in Africa reflects the continent's growing economy. In 2016, the gross domestic product of Africa was estimated at $1.6 trillion. That number is expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2020.

Casino resorts are not the only type of development underway in Africa. In March of 2018, construction began on a new Free Zone outside Cairo. The zone will include industrial parks, residential areas, and a golf course.

Africa is also home to some of the world's fastest-growing cities. By 2030, seven of the ten fastest-growing cities in the world will be in Africa. These cities offer opportunities for businesses looking to expand into new markets.

A number of American companies are already taking advantage of these opportunities. IBM recently announced plans to open a new research center in Johannesburg. The center will focus on developing artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.

Microsoft has also announced plans to invest in Africa's technology sector. The company plans to open two new data centers in South Africa this year. Microsoft says that the data centers will make it easier for African businesses to use its cloud services.
