#  Federal agents raid offshore internet casino operation 

Federal agents raided an offshore internet casino operation on Tuesday. According to authorities, the raid was part of a larger crackdown on internet gambling that has been taking place in recent months.

The casino, which is located in the Caribbean, was said to be one of the largest and most popular online casinos in the world. It is believed that the site took in more than $1 billion in bets last year alone.

As part of the crackdown, several individuals who are associated with the casino have been arrested and charged with various crimes, including money laundering and racketeering.

Law enforcement officials say that the raid is just the beginning, and that they plan to continue cracking down on illegal internet gambling operations in the future.

#  FBI seizes $10 million in assets from illegal online gambling ring 

On Wednesday, the FBI announced that it had seized $10 million in assets from an illegal online gambling ring. The operation was part of a larger crackdown on internet gambling, which has been illegal in the United States since 2006.

The gambling ring was based in Costa Rica and laundering its profits through various shell companies. It is estimated that the ring took in over $50 million in bets over the past two years.

The FBI seized assets including luxury cars, homes, and bank accounts. In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that the seizure was "a major step forward in our efforts to shut down illegal online gambling."

Online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and many of the largest companies are based outside of the United States. In recent years, there has been an increased effort by law enforcement to crack down on illegal gambling operations within the United States.

#  Italian police seize $27 million in assets from illegal online gambling ring 

Italian police seized $27 million in assets Wednesday from an illegal online gambling ring.

3 people were arrested in connection with the ring, which was operating out of an office building in the city of Naples.

Police seized computers, cash, and luxury cars as part of the investigation.

"The seizure is one of the biggestever carried out against a criminal organisation specialising in online gambling," a police spokesman said.

#  Dutch police arrest 11 people in connection with illegal online gambling ring 

The Dutch police have arrested 11 people in connection with an illegal online gambling ring. The suspects are believed to have made millions of euros from the scam.

Investigators believe that the ring was active for nearly a decade, and that it managed to avoid detection by using a complex network of shell companies and bank accounts.

Some of the suspects have already appeared in court, where they denied any wrongdoing. They claim that they were only involved in marketing and providing support services for the gambling operation.

However, the police argue that the suspects were actively involved in running the gambling ring, and that they stand to make significant profits from it.

This is not the first time that Dutch authorities have cracked down on an illegal online gambling ring. In 2012, they shut down a similar operation that had been earning millions of euros each year.

#  Illegal online gambling ring busted, $50 million seized

Authorities have shut down an illegal online gambling ring and seized more than $50 million in assets, including luxury cars and real estate.

The operation, which was headquartered in Costa Rica, took in more than $1.2 billion in bets over the past two years. It is believed to be one of the largest online gambling operations ever shut down.

“This was a well-funded and sophisticated operation that posed a significant threat to the integrity of our gaming industry,” said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Law enforcement officials raided 26 properties in New York and Costa Rica as part of the investigation. They also seized dozens of high-end cars, including a Ferrari, a Rolls-Royce, and a Lamborghini.

Several people have been arrested in connection with the operation, including the alleged ringleader, who has been charged with money laundering and other crimes.

This is just the latest example of law enforcement cracking down on illegal online gambling operations. In recent years, several large-scale operations have been shut down, including ones run by Russian and Israeli criminals.
