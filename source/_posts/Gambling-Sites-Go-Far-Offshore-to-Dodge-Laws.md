#  Gambling Sites Go Far Offshore to Dodge Laws

Gambling sites have been moving their operations offshore in order to evade gambling laws, a new study has found.

The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford released a report this week that found many gambling sites are moving their operations to countries where gambling is legal, but the sites are not regulated.

The study looked at 31 of the biggest gambling companies, and found that 20 of them had moved some or all of their operations to countries such as Malta, Gibraltar, and the Isle of Man.

According to BBC News, these countries have less restrictive gambling laws, and they also offer online gaming licenses that are much cheaper than those in other countries. For instance, it costs just £10,000 ($13,000) to get a license in Malta, compared to £500,000 ($660,000) in the United Kingdom.

This exodus of gambling sites has caused alarm among regulators and lawmakers worldwide. In an interview with Reuters, one lawmaker described it as "the Wild West."

"Offshore operators are able to circumvent regulation by setting up shop in territories where there is little or no concern for protecting consumers or ensuring that operators abide by best practice," said Neil Addison, a law professor at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

One problem with this trend is that it makes it difficult for regulators to enforce gambling laws. For example, if a site is based in Malta but licensed in Gibraltar, which has more lax regulations, then the Maltese regulator would have no authority to take action against the site.

This problem was highlighted last year when the British Gambling Commission (GC) tried to shut down two Gibraltar-based betting sites that were targeting British customers. However, because the sites were licensed in Gibraltar, the GC had no authority to take them down.

In response to this problem, some lawmakers are calling for tighter regulations on online gambling operators. For example, last year British Labour MP Matt Western introduced a bill that would require all online casinos operating in Britain to be licensed by the UKGC. The bill did not pass Parliament however.

Gambling industry insiders say that the move offshore is necessary due to increasing regulation around the world. In an interview with Reuters, Geoff Howard-Williams of Gaming Compliance said that "the days when you could flick a switch and open up shop anywhere are long gone."

#  Gambling Sites Move to offshore Havens to Evade Taxes

Gambling sites are moving to offshore havens to evade taxes, according to a report from the Reuters news agency.

The Reuters report found that many gambling operators have established companies in tax havens such as Malta, Gibraltar, and the Isle of Man in order to minimize their tax liabilities.

Malta is particularly popular among online gambling companies because it has low corporate taxes and relaxed regulations. The Isle of Man, meanwhile, offers tax breaks for companies that set up shop there.

Reuters spoke to representatives from several online gambling operators who said they had established operations in offshore havens. One executive said that his company had moved its headquarters to Malta specifically to avoid paying taxes in the United Kingdom.

The news agency also found evidence that some gambling sites were using shell companies in offshore havens to disguise their ownership structures. This allows them to avoid paying taxes on profits while still making it appear as if they are based in a different country.

Gambling sites have been under pressure from regulators in recent years due to concerns about money laundering and addiction. In response, many of them have shifted their business away from individual gamblers and towards corporate customers. This has allowed them to reduce their tax liabilities by establishing separate companies for each line of business.

The Reuters report is likely to add to the pressure on gambling operators to pay more taxes. Earlier this year, the UK government introduced a new “point of consumption” tax which will require gambling operators based in the UK to pay 15% on all bets placed by British customers.

#  The Dark Side of the Online Gambling Industry

Online gambling is one of the most popular and lucrative industries in the world. However, as with any industry, there are a few bad apples that can spoil the bunch. In the online gambling industry, these bad apples are known as “ rogue operators .”

Rogue operators are online casinos and betting sites that operate illegally or unethically. They often scam players out of their money, offer shoddy customer support, and use dishonest tactics to lure people into depositing money.

Because of the risks associated with rogue operators, it is important to do your research before choosing an online casino or betting site. Be sure to read reviews from trusted sources, and only deposit money with operators that have a good reputation.

If you do happen to fall victim to a rogue operator, don’t be afraid to seek help. There are many organisations that can help you get your money back, such as the Gambling Commission of Great Britain or the Better Business Bureau .

#  How Online Gambling Sites are Evading the Law

Online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, but the law has been unable to keep up with its rapid growth. Gambling sites are able to evade the law by basing themselves in offshore locations or using pseudonyms.

One of the most popular gambling sites is PokerStars, which is based in the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown dependency, and it has been a popular location for online gambling companies because it has lax regulation. PokerStars was founded in 2001 and is now the world's largest online poker site. It has more than 100 million registered users, and it processed more than $2 billion in transactions in 2014.

PokerStars was able to become so successful because it was able to evade the law. The U.S. government passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006, which made it illegal for banks and credit card companies to process transactions for online gambling sites. But PokerStars was able to continue operating by moving its operations offshore. The company was later acquired by Amaya Inc., which is based in Montreal.

Another popular gambling site is Bet365, which is based in Gibraltar. Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern coast of Spain. It has been a popular location for online gambling companies because it has a lenient licensing regime and favourable tax laws. Bet365 was founded in 2000 and now has more than 16 million customers worldwide.

Like PokerStars, Bet365 was able to evade the law by moving its operations offshore. The company is now owned by Stoke City Football Club, which is based in Stoke-on-Trent, England.

The growth of online gambling has outpaced the law, but there are signs that the law may be starting to catch up. In 2016, Amaya Inc., which owns PokerStars and Bet365, agreed to pay $870 million to settle charges that it violated UIGEA. And in 2017, three major British banks—Barclays, HSBC, and Lloyds—ceased processing payments for online gambling sites because of concerns about money laundering.

The growth of online gambling may be coming to an end as a result of stricter regulation from governments around the world

#  Why Gambling Sites are Moving Offshore

Legal experts suggest there are multiple reasons for gambling sites to move offshore. Regulatory requirements are one factor, but other reasons include taxation and blocking of payment services.

Gambling sites have been moving offshore for many years, with the UK being a popular destination. However, in recent years, the US has become an increasingly difficult place to operate a gambling site. The legal landscape is constantly changing, with new regulations and restrictions being introduced all the time. For example, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 made it illegal for financial institutions to process payments to online gambling sites.

As a result, many gambling sites are moving to offshore jurisdictions where the regulatory environment is more favourable. Offshore jurisdictions typically have less restrictive laws and less rigorous regulatory requirements. This makes it easier for gambling sites to set up and operate legally. Additionally, offshore jurisdictions often have lower taxation rates, which can save companies significant sums of money.

Another reason for gambling sites to move offshore is the threat of payment blocking. Some countries (e.g. the US) have begun blocking payments to known gambling sites. This can be a major problem for gambling companies as it can significantly reduce their revenue streams. By moving to an offshore jurisdiction, companies can avoid this payment blocking and continue doing business as usual.

There are many benefits to operating a gambling site in an offshore jurisdiction. The regulatory environment is more favourable, taxes are lower, and payment blocking is less of a problem. Offshore jurisdictions offer a safe and secure location for companies to do business and provide a level playing field for all operators
