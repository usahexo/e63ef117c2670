#  Slot Game that Makes the Most Sense in Double Lower Casino Dominica

The Slot Game that Makes the Most Sense in Double Lower Casino Dominica is derived from the popular game of Twenty-One. Like its predecessor, it is played with a Deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to score 21 points or a greater total than the dealer, without exceeding 21.

Players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down. In order to win, the player must beat the dealers total score without going over 21. If the player goes over 21, then they have lost regardless of what the dealer’s score is.Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each, Aces are worth 1 or 11 points and all other cards are worth their face value. After both players have been dealt their two cards, the dealer will turn over their facedown card.

If you beat the dealers total score with your first two cards without exceeding 21 then this is called a “natural” or “blackjack” and you will win 2 to 1 on your bet. If you draw another card that takes your total over 21 then this is called a “bust” and you lose automatically even if the dealer also busts with their next card.


Each player initially places an equal bet in the betting circles located at each position aroundthe table. After all bets have been placed, each player is given 2 chips which must be placedface up in front of them on either of the 2 betting circles closest to them (but not on any otherplayers chip). The betting action then starts at the first position to Dealer's leftand moves clockwise around the table. 
After all bets have been placed, both players are given two chips which they place face-up in frontof them on either of these betting circles with their immediate neighbour also havinga bet on that number - but not on any other player's chip:




 
The Dealer will then give each player an additional card with Ace always counting as11 points and picture cards counting as 10 points. In our example - Player 1 now hascard no: 8 & 9 (8+9=17), Player 2 has card no: K & 7 (King+7=16), and Dealer hastwo revealed cards: 6 & 3 (6+3=9).
The Dealer will now turn over their facedown card which is revealed as an Ace – so theirtotal count becomes 20 (9 + 10 +1 = 20). Both Players now have 2 options: "stand" - OR- "take hit". IfPlayer 1 stands then their total count remains 17 whilst Player 2 now has totalscore of 18 since they took a hit when they had 16 points; resulting in Dealer takingthe pot as they have 20 or more points).  If both players take a hit then theywould add whatever new card they were given to their previous total - so P1 wouldnow have 25 pts (17+8) and P2 would now have 26 pts (16+10), but Dealer would stillwin as they would have 28 pts (20+8) or more at this point.
