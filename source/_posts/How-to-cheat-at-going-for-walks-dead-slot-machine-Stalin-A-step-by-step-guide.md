Building a profitable slot machine strategy is tougher than it seems. For many first timers, the instinct is to simply keep feeding money into the machine in the hope of recouping their losses plus more. But this isn't always the smartest idea – and in some cases can lead to even greater financial woes.

With this in mind, it's important that you arm yourself with the right know-how before you sit down at any slot machine. So to give you a head start, we've put together our top tips for how to beat the odds and come out on top:

1)amiliarize yourself with the game rules
Before you even think about putting any money into a slot machine, make sure you're familiar with all of the game rules. Each different title will have its own unique set of guidelines, so it's important that you understand how they work before playing.

2)Set yourself a limit & stick to itThis one is pretty self-explanatory – but it's crucial that you set yourself a limit and stick to it! Don't let your emotions take over and convince you to bet more than you can afford. Likewise, try not to get carried away if you're enjoying a winning streak – always be mindful of your bankroll and what's left in it.

3)Choose machines wiselySlot machines come in all shapes and sizes, with each offering different winning potentials. So make sure you do your research before settling on a particular game – there's no point playing something that offers little chance of winning!

4)Play maximum linesThis might seem like an obvious one, but many players forget to play maximum lines when they're trying to maximise their chances of winning. By playing fewer lines, you're essentially reducing your chances of hitting the jackpot – so always play as many as possible for best results.

5)Avoid progressive jackpot gamesProgressive jackpot games are undoubtedly tempting – but they're also some of the hardest titles to win on. If your goal is to make money rather than just have fun, then it's best to steer clear of these high variance games altogether.
