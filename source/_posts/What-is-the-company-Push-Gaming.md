One summer day, three friends, Bill, Bob and Ted, were sitting around a picnic table in the park discussing their future. They all agreed that they wanted to start their own business, but they didn’t have any ideas.

Suddenly, Bill had an idea. “Why don’t we start a company that sells ice cream?” he said.

The others liked the idea and they all decided to get started. They pooled their money and bought some ice cream trucks. Then they spent the summer driving around town selling ice cream.

The company was a success and the friends decided to keep it going the following year. They bought more trucks and hired more drivers. The business continued to grow and soon they were shipping ice cream all over the country.
