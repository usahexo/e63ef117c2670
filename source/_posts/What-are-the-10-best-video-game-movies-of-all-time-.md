#  What are the 10 best video game movies of all time? 

There are a number of great video game movies out there, but which are the best? Here is a list of the 10 best video game movies of all time, according to gamer.

#10 - "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"

This 2010 movie was based on the popular video game series of the same name. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Prince Dastan, a street urchin who becomes involved in a conspiracy to control an ancient dagger capable of reversing time. While it may not be the deepest or most original movie on this list, "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" is still a fun and enjoyable watch.

#9 - "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"

Released in 2001, "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" was one of the first attempts at bringing a popular video game franchise to the big screen. While it wasn't a box office success, the movie has since gained a cult following. "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" tells the story of scientist Aki Ross and her quest to stop an alien invasion using energy from supernatural spirits.

#8 - "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"

The 2001 movie based on the popular Tomb Raider video game franchise starred Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, and was a major success both critically and commercially. Jolie's performance as Croft was praised, and the movie itself is full of exciting action scenes and thrilling stunts. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, then "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" is definitely worth checking out.

#7 - "Warcraft"

2016's "Warcraft" was not quite as well-received by critics as some of the other movies on this list, but it has still managed to become one of the most successful video game movies ever made. The film tells the story of two warring factions, the humans and the orcs, with each side represented by its own cast of actors. If you're looking for an epic fantasy adventure, then you'll definitely want to check out "Warcraft".

#6 - "Resident Evil"

The popular Resident Evil video game franchise got its start in 1996 with the release of the eponymous survival horror game for PlayStation. In 2002, Resident Evil was adapted into a movie starring Milla Jovovich, and while it received mixed reviews from critics it was nonetheless successful at the box office. Jovovich reprises her role as Alice in subsequent sequels released in 2004, 2007 and 2012. If you're looking for some good old-fashioned zombie action then Resident Evil is definitely worth watching.

#  What defines a great video game movie? 

The video game movie genre remains one of the most controversial and divisive forms of cinema. While there are a few diamonds in the rough, the vast majority of video game movies tend to be panned by critics and audiences alike. So what exactly makes a great video game movie?

First and foremost, the film needs to capture the essence of the game it is based on. This means that the characters, story, setting, and gameplay need to be faithful to the source material. If done correctly, this can result in a film that is both true to the game it is based on and enjoyable for non-gamers as well.

 Secondly, the film must have competent direction and filmmaking. It's all too easy for video game movies to feel like cheap cash-ins or adaptations done by people who don't really understand video games or filmmaking. As such, it's important that the people responsible for making the movie know what they're doing and are passionate about creating a good film.

Lastly, the cast and acting need to be strong. Many video game movies tend to have poor acting, which can make or break the film. If the actors can't convey emotion or aren't believable in their roles, then the whole movie will suffer.

So those are three key elements that make up a great video game movie: capturing the essence of the game, competent direction and filmmaking, and strong acting. If a movie can nail all three of these elements, then it has a good chance of being successful.

#  Are video game movies doomed to fail? 

With the release of "Assassin's Creed" in December 2016 and "Uncharted" being announced not too long ago, it seems that Hollywood is keen on making video game movies. But are they doomed to fail?

There have been a few high-profile video game movie adaptations that have been released in recent years, and most of them have fared quite poorly with both critics and audiences. "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", "Silent Hill", "Max Payne", and "Resident Evil: The Final Chapter" were all box office bombs, earning less than their production costs. Even last year's critically acclaimed "Warcraft" was a financial disappointment.

So what's the reason for this track record? There are a few factors that seem to contribute to video game movies' lack of success. For one, most video games are not story-driven and rely heavily on gameplay, which does not always translate well to film. Additionally, the plots of most video games tend to be very convoluted and full of exposition, which can be difficult to adapt for a movie audience. And finally, many video game movies simply don't look very good visually, which further contributes to their poor reception.

But that's not to say that all video game movies are doomed to fail. There have been a few exceptions, such as "Angry Birds" and "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". And with films like "Assassin's Creed" and "Uncharted" employing top-notch visual effects teams, there's definitely potential for some great-looking video game movies in the future.

So will Hollywood ever get video game movies right? Only time will tell. But with more and more big-budget video game adaptations being announced, it's clear that they're determined to try.

#  What needs to be done to make them better? 

There are a lot of ways to make your life better. You can start by working on yourself and then work on your relationships with others. Once you have both of those areas covered, you can move on to your professional and financial life.

The first step is to work on yourself. You need to be happy and content with who you are before you can start making changes in your life. You need to find out what makes you happy and do more of those things. You also need to find out what stresses you out and try to reduce or eliminate those things from your life.

The next step is to work on your relationships with others. You need to have healthy and positive relationships with the people in your life. This includes family, friends, and significant others. You need to be able to trust and rely on these people, and they need to be able to do the same for you.

The third step is to work on your professional life. This includes your job, education, and career goals. You need to be doing something that you enjoy and are passionate about. You also need to be working towards goals that are important to you.

The fourth step is to work on your financial life. This includes getting out of debt, saving money, and investing for the future. You need to have a plan for your money and be working towards long-term financial goals.

By following these four steps, you can make significant changes in your life and start living the life you want to live.

#  How can Hollywood make video game movies more successful?

For years Hollywood has been trying to make video game movies more successful, but they have failed to do so. Why is this the case? What can be done to change this?

One of the main reasons why video game movies have failed in Hollywood is because the studios have not been taking into account what makes video games successful in the first place. Video games are interactive, and people enjoy playing them because they can control the characters and the story. This is why many video game movie adaptations have been unsuccessful, because they have been trying to tell a story that is already predetermined.

There are a few things that Hollywood can do in order to make video game movies more successful. Firstly, they need to take into account what makes video games fun and interactive, and then try and incorporate those elements into the movie adaptation. Secondly, they need to hire screenwriters who are familiar with writing for video games, as opposed to traditional movies. This will help to ensure that the story is properly adapted for a video game movie. Finally, Hollywood needs to market these movies differently than traditional movies. They need to target gamers specifically, as well as fans of the source material, in order to get them interested in seeing the movie adaptation.

Doing these things should help Hollywood make video game movies more successful. By adapting stories that are faithful to the source material, incorporating interactive elements into the movie, and targeting gamers specifically, Hollywood can create a new wave of successful video game movie adaptations.
