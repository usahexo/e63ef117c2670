Adams, who is from Canada, arrived in Sin City on Sunday and headed straight to the casino floor. He started playing blackjack and within minutes had racked up a $2,000 chip stack.</p>
<p>Adams then decided to try his luck at the DoubleDown slots and hit the jackpot for $10,000! In total, the lucky Canadian walked away from the casino with over $12,000 in winnings. Adams says he plans to use his winnings to pay off some bills and enjoy a nice dinner out.</p>
<p>It just goes to show that anyone can win big at the casino – even if you’re not a local! So next time you’re in Las Vegas, don’t be afraid to take a chance on the free games at DoubleDown Casino. You might be surprised at what you can win!</p>
<h1 id="Foreigner-Doubles-Down-and-Wins-Big-on-FREE-Chips-at-Casino"><a href="#Foreigner-Doubles-Down-and-Wins-Big-on-FREE-Chips-at-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Foreigner Doubles Down and Wins Big on FREE Chips at Casino!"></a>Foreigner Doubles Down and Wins Big on FREE Chips at Casino!</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - 30-year old Zhang Wei had some unfinished business at the casinos in Las Vegas. Two years ago, he had cashed out $500 in chips, only to lose it all playing blackjack. This time around, he was determined to walk away a winner.</p>
<p>He started by playing roulette with $100 in chips, doubling his money in just a few spins. He then moved on to blackjack, where he again doubled his starting amount. By the end of the evening, Zhang had amassed a total of $10,000 in chips - all from free casino play!</p>
<p>Asked about his strategy, Zhang simply said “I just kept doubling down on whatever I had - and it worked!”</p>
<p>It’s not often that the house falls victim to a high roller like Zhang, but on this night it did. And while no one can say for sure if he would have won if he’d played for real money, there’s no doubt that he walked away a big winner thanks to the casino’s generosity!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gives-Foreigner-200-in-Free-Chips-and-He-Turns-it-Into-4-000"><a href="#Casino-Gives-Foreigner-200-in-Free-Chips-and-He-Turns-it-Into-4-000" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gives Foreigner $200 in Free Chips and He Turns it Into $4,000!"></a>Casino Gives Foreigner $200 in Free Chips and He Turns it Into $4,000!</h1><p>Foreigner visiting Vegas hit with free $200 in casino chips, but instead of walking away he turned it into $4,000!</p>
<p>Casino officials were shocked this past weekend when a foreign visitor walked up to the betting table with a $200 chip in hand. The man had apparently been given the chip as a promotional gift from the casino, but rather than walk away with nothing to show for it, he put the chip to use and managed to turn it into a whopping $4,000!</p>
<p>According to reports, the man was playing blackjack and managed to make some shrewd bets that paid off big time. In the end, he walked away with more than quadruple what he started with – not bad for a few hours’ work!</p>
<p>Casino officials were understandably thrilled with the man’s success and praised him for his skills. They also said that they were excited to see how much he would have won if he’d kept playing.</p>
<p>While this story is certainly an anomaly, it goes to show that anything can happen in Vegas – even turning a free chip into thousands of dollars! If you want to try your luck at gambling, there’s no better place than Las Vegas – just be sure to bring your A-game!</p>
<h1 id="Foreigner-Casinos-It-All-Away-on-Free-Chips-and-Loses-BIG"><a href="#Foreigner-Casinos-It-All-Away-on-Free-Chips-and-Loses-BIG" class="headerlink" title="Foreigner Casinos It All Away on Free Chips and Loses BIG!"></a>Foreigner Casinos It All Away on Free Chips and Loses BIG!</h1><p>Foreigners visiting Macau are turning to casinos in the hopes of making a quick buck, but are instead losing millions of dollars in free chips, according to a report by The Macau Daily Times.</p>
<p>The report cites data from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau which shows that in the first five months of this year, foreigners lost almost HK$2 billion (US$254 million) in free chips. That is more than double the amount they lost during the same period last year.</p>
<p>While locals continue to account for the lion’s share of casino spending in Macau – spending almost HK$100 billion (US$12.8 billion) in free chips so far this year – their losses have actually decreased slightly compared to last year.</p>
<p>Analysts say that many foreign visitors are not familiar with how the casino system works and end up gambling away all their money on free chips. Once their money is gone, they often have no choice but to leave the city without having made any profits.</p>
