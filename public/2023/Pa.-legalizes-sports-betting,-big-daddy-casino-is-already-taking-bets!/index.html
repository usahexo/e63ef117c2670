The bill now goes to the Senate for approval before it heads to Governor Tom Wolf’s desk to be signed into law.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will bring in much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing a budget shortfall. They also argue that it will help keep people from gambling illegally.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and crime.</p>

Here’s what you need to know about Pennsylvania sports betting and where you can place your bets!</p>
<p>The first legal bets in Pennsylvania were placed on Tuesday, September 18 at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course near Harrisburg. The casino is one of 10 licensed to offer sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>So far, only five of those casinos have announced they are up and running with sports betting: Hollywood Casino at Penn National, Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino, Rivers Casino, and Mount Airy Casino Resort.</p>
<p>Bets will be available on all major professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, and golf.</p>
<p>You must be 21 years or older to bet in Pennsylvania. You can place bets in person at a casino or online.</p>
<p>To place a bet online, you must create an account with a licensed PA sports betting provider. You can then deposit money into your account and bet from there. Minimum bets are $2.</p>
<p>There is a 10 percent tax on gross gaming revenue from sports betting in Pennsylvania. That money will go towards property tax reduction for homeowners, local governments, and counties across the state.</p>
<p>So far, the state has generated over $3 million in taxes from sports betting.</p>
